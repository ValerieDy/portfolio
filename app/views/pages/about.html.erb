      <p class="lead">
        Hi, I’m Valeriia — a passionate <strong>QA Automation Engineer</strong> with a strong background in software testing and automation frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my career in software quality assurance, where I built expertise in <strong>functional testing</strong>, <strong>test automation</strong>, and <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>. My goal is to deliver reliable, high-quality applications that provide the best user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working with modern testing tools and frameworks such as <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, <strong>Selenium</strong>, <strong>Cucumber</strong>, and <strong>CircleCI</strong>. My focus is on creating scalable, maintainable test suites that speed up development and improve confidence in product releases.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I aim to expand my skills into <strong>DevOps</strong> and <strong>cloud-based test automation</strong>, while continuing to improve my programming skills.
